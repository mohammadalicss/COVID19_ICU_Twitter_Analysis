# COVID19 ICU Twitter Analysis
This project explores ICU-related discussions on Twitter during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic (January 1â€“June 14, 2020). Using a dataset of 120,555 tweets, retweets, and quote tweets, it provides insights into tweet frequency trends, participant demographics, sentiments, and prevalent topics. Presented at the National Communication Association (NCA) conference 2024 in New Orleans, Lousiana, in the United States, this study will further explore frames centering ICU, physicians, and USA president computationally. 

## Objectives
+ Understand tweet frequency trends over the six months from January 2020 to June 2020 (RQ1).
+ Analyze participant diversity in terms of region, gender, and language (RQ2).
+ Conduct sentiment analysis of ICU-related discussions (RQ3).
+ Identify key topics using topic modeling (RQ4).
+ Explore frames (RQ5)

## Methods
+ Data collected using Sysomos and ICU-related keywords.
+ Sentiment analysis with VADER (NLTK library).
+ Topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
+ Descriptive and statistical analyses of user demographics.
+ Computationally explore frames using Sentiment-based Unsupervised Framing Analysis (SUFA) Approach 

## Preliminary Key Findings
+ RQ1: Peaks in March and April 2020 correspond to major pandemic events.
+ RQ2: Tweets originated from 192 countries in 62 languages, with English as the dominant language.
+ RQ3: Most tweets (59%) showed positive sentiment, with 16% negative and 26% neutral.
+ RQ4: Topic modeling is in progress.
+ RQ5: Computational framing analysis is in progress

## Theoretical framework 
+ Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)
+ Health Belief Model

## Python script, sample data, and output  
I have executed and tested this script on Google Colab. It can be modified to run in other environments. The Python script included in this repository includes:
+ Little data pre-processing steps
+ Descriptive analysis 
+ Time-series analysis 
+ Sentiment analysis 
+ LDA-based topic modeling 

Requirements

Python libraries, used in the script, include:
requests
BeautifulSoup (from bs4)
pandas
os
csv
